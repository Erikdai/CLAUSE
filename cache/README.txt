Cache Directory - Placeholder Notice
===================================

Due to supplementary material size limitations, the complete index files cannot be uploaded here.
This directory serves as a placeholder for demonstration purposes only.

The complete index cache will be built automatically when you run subgraph_builder.py.

Contents that will be generated:
- Node embeddings and FAISS indexes
- Relation embeddings
- Graph structure caches
- Entity alignment mappings

To generate the complete cache:
1. Ensure your dataset is properly configured
2. Run: python subgraph_builder.py
3. The cache files will be automatically generated in this directory

Note: The initial cache generation may take some time depending on your dataset size.
